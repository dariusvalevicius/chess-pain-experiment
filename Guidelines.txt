CHESS CODING GUIDING ROUTE
--------------------------

Goal: Coding a chess puzzle interface to run the fMRI experiment. The participant will be able to:

DONE	- See the chess board					
DONE		- Have a chess board displayed		
DONE		- Use the correct font for the board and the pieces	
DONE	- Interact with it using a mouse
DONE		- Have to be able to play a move by clicking with the left click
DONE		- Snap the pieces in the center of the squares

DONE - (Hightlight the possible squares for each pieces when clicked on it) Not mandatory
	
DONE - Do not allow incorrect moves		board.legal_moves
	Still to do
	Castling
	En passant
	Check
	Mate
	
	When a square is selected, show it colored
	
	
	
	- Solve Puzzles
DONE	- Have to display a specific position given a FEN position
DONE	- Play the first move of the puzzle FEN given
		- Play the opponent's moves (Automatic response)
		- Hightlight the last move played
DONE	- Change the move nb (meaning if it's black or white to play)
DONE	- Record the moves tried
		- Check if the puzzle is solved or not (Compare with the recorded moves)
		- Record the timing of the puzzle and the global timing
		- Display the clock
		- If clock = 0, goes over the next puzzle
		- Look for puzzle in the Database
		- If Puzzle is failed/solved/time out, go on with the next puzzle and restart the puzzle procedure)
		
	If it's black to play, show it from black's perspective
	(Showing who is to play) Fine not to do it if we rotate the board
